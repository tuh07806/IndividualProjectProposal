## Project Abstract

This open source project is an android mobile application tailored towards college students, hosted on Google’s Firebase platform. The application addresses the needs of college students and acts as a centralized platform where students can share notes, keep track of their attendance, collaborate with peers, and find the latest events around campus. This project aims to bring convenience and accessibility for college students, utilizing SQLite and Firebase to host it’s data in the back end and Material UI as the front end React framework. The open issues range from migrating an SQLite database to data encryption.
